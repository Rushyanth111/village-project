This info. will ensure that their shanties are not demolished by any govt. agency in the grab of getting the land vacated. The Delhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana Certificates would contain the following information:-Name of head of familyFamily photographCode numberSurvey code number by DUSIBVoter Identity (ID) card numberThese certificates will also ensure that Jhuggi jhopadi residents also get pucca houses of their own. No govt. agency will now demolish any jhuggi and once people get new houses, they can demolish their jhuggi themselves before moving to new houses.Opposition on Delhi CM Housing Scheme for JJ Cluster ResidentsOpposition alleges that distribution of Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana Certificates is a deliberate attempt to mislead and misguide innocent people just ahead of assembly elections in Delhi. Aam Aadmi Party promised in its 2015 manifesto to provide flats or plots to JJ cluster dwellers within or near their residencies. Today after 5 years of AAP govt in power, distribution of certificates is nothing more than piece of paper.Though the state govt. had earlier planned to survey all 675 Jhuggi Jhopadi clusters, Delhi Development Authority recently wrote to DUSIB that it will carry out its own assessment of slums that have come out of land belonging to central government agencies.Delhi CM Housing Scheme Jhuggi Jhopadi ResidentsDelhi Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana BackgroundCM said that he understands the troubles faced by people in slum areas as he himself lived in slums for some time. He lived in jhuggi while working for an NGO. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and CM Kejriwal used to get furious at govt. for being inconsiderate and merciless towards problems faced by JJ residents. Both of them decided to work towards constructing legitimate dwelling spaces for slum dwellers. He also slammed previous govt\u2019s for not working for welfare of slum dwellers and considering them only as vote bank.The state govt. has already provided pucca houses to 5,000 families and all housesholds are happy since they are getting all basic amenities. The CM Housing scheme certificates are surety of non destruction and non enroachment of slums and surety of getting pucca houses.Delhi government has also issued their report card on quality education and free health services and termed their tenure as excellent.
