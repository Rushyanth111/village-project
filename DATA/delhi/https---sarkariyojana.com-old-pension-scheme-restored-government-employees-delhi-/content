Delhi CM slammed the new pension scheme as betrayal and cheating with the government employees. He wants that the Old Pension Scheme needs to be restored and so this decision will be passed in the special session of Delhi legislative assembly. Central govt. cannot accomplish the task of nation building by disappointing the govt. employees.", "002-normal": "Delhi govt. has performed well in the areas of education, health, power and water supply due to consistent cooperation and support of its employees. The new pension scheme was introduced by the central government in FY 2004. Under the New Pension Scheme, employees contribute towards pension from their monthly salary and the same amount of contribution is made by the employer. Pension fund managers then invests the funds in the earmarked investment schemes.", "003-normal": "CM said that it was destiny as the Constitution Day is celebrated on 26 November 1949 and on the similar day, AAP was formed in 2012. Mukhyamantri of Delhi accuses PM Modi of creating hurdles in his work and in the functioning of Delhi government. So, CM would fight with the central government to implement the Old Pension Scheme which is a long term demand of the employees."}}
