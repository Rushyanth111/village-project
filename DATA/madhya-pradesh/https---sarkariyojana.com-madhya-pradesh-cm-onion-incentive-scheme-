Now, all the buyers (traders) will not be able to purchase onions at less than Rs. 800 per quintal. Moreover, traders who buy farmers for price higher than Rs. 800 per quintal and sell onions in Mandis outside the state will get 75% grant of expenditure on transport and storage.", "002-normal": "In addition to this, in case the state co-operative marketing committees or agricultural producers organization sell the onion purchased from farmers outside the MP state, then such organizations would get cent percent compensation of cost of transport and storage.", "003-normal": "Despite all these efforts, in case all prices fall below Rs. 800 per quintal in the market in May and June months, then the difference amount b/w model selling price of fixed mandis and support price of Rs. 800 / quintal would be directly credited to the bank accounts of farmers. To avail this difference amount, farmers must be registered and must have sell onions during this period alone.", "004-normal": "CM Kamal Nath urges all the farmers to not to bring their entire onion for sale in market. This is because as the farmers brings their entire produce in the market, then it causes unnecessary pressure on onion prices (price fall). So, farmers must only sell onions of the amount which they require at the time of arrival of crop. Accordingly, farmers can simply store the remaining produce of onions. This move will not have any impact on the prices of onions in the Mandis and the farmers will get fair prices of their crop."}}
