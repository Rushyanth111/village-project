Parali Incentive Scheme 2019 for small & marginal farmers, Rs. 100 per quintal for not burning stubble in fields, only applicable to non Basmati paddy procured by governmentHaryana Parali Incentive Scheme to Curb Stubble BurningParali (Stubble) burning has become a major cause of pollution in recent days. Many farmers in Haryana and Punjab burns their stubble in order to get their farm land ready for next season cultivation. The smoke emission from parali burning contains pollutants and is choking nearby state Delhi. The NCT of Delhi is just like gas chamber these days due to harmful levels of Air Quality Index (AQI).PM 2.5 & PM 10 levels in national capital are beyond hazardous level due to parali burning. SC has already put a ban on burning of stubble in these 2 states, but the no. of incidents of stubble burning are not reducing. This is because farmers are poor in both Haryana and Punjab states.The parali machine price is not affordable as it costs around 15 lakh per machine even after getting subsidy from central govt. Moreover, the rent of parali machine is too high for farmers which they cannot afford. So to reduce the level of pollution in Delhi, Supreme Court has ordered Punjab and Haryana state govt\u2019s to provide incentives to farmers.\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u092f \u0915\u0947 \u091b\u094b\u091f\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u0938\u0940\u092e\u093e\u0902\u0924 \u0915\u093f\u0938\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u0928 \u091c\u0932\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f 100 \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f \u0915\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0902\u091f\u0932 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0938\u093e\u0939\u0928 \u0930\u093e\u0936\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0947\u0917\u0940 \u0939\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0923\u093e \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 pic.twitter.com/lfnGooqEe4\u2014 CMO Haryana (@cmohry) November 12, 2019 In lines with SC order, Haryana govt. has decided to start Parali Incentive Scheme 2019.
