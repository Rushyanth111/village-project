In one acre, around 30 quintal paddy (parmal) is produced and a farmer earns around Rs. 30,000 per acre. This earning is after excluding the input cost which is over Rs. 20,000 per acre.The Haryana govt\u2019s agricultural production programmes have been determined by the need for national food security. Central govt. is providing a remunerative price which leads to certainty among farmers for marketing of paddy. But because of the assured marketing pf paddy under MSP, even non-rice producing areas have taken up paddy production on large scale which is depleting groundwater levels.Moreover, cultivation of paddy has contributed to degradation of natural resources such as water and soil. So to protect the natural resources and to raise the earnings of farmers, the govt. has started Mera Pani Meri Virasat Scheme.\u092e\u0947\u0930\u093e \u092a\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0930\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0924 @mlkhattar pic.twitter.com/oBRnY1GV9D\u2014 Haryana BJP (@BJP4Haryana) May 15, 2020 Protect Depleting Groundwater Levels in Dark ZonesAs per the report, there are 36 blocks in dark zone as ground water level depletion rate has been doubled in the past 12 years.

Farmers can now grow crops such as maize, arhar, urad, guar, cotton, bajra, til and grishm moong (baisakhi moong). These crops will save water and will also ensure the availability of water for future generations.Haryana govt. is already giving 80% subsidy to farmers who have adopted micro-irrigation and drip irrigation system along with growing alternative crops in place of paddy. The farmers of the state must promote water conservation and save water for future generations in the same way they leave their land as inheritance for their coming generations.
