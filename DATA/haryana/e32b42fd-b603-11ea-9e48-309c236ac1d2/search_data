This identity certificate would ensure automatic delivery of various citizen-centric services to people and will also curb corruption. Moreover, with the creation of database of all families, the benefits of social welfare schemes will reach the actual beneficiaries automatically and remove duplicity.Haryana Parivar Pehchan Patra Portal BenefitsParivar Pehchan Patra Portal is going to speed up the operation of 100% success in Mera Parivar \u2013 Meri Pehchan programme. Migrant families can upload their information on this portal after leaving the place so that their previous information could be removed.There would be 3 digits for the village and 5 digits for family in Parivar Pehchan Patra. No individual digit will be there for the citizen. With this step, Haryana govt. is moving forward towards ensuring transparency in identifying the family and its uplift, mapping and providing benefits.
