Former CM Vasundhara Raje accused current CM Ashok Gehlot on renaming the food scheme. She mentioned that the ruling Rajasthan govt. is expert in changing the names of the previous govt. welfare schemes.Congress party has renamed the Annapurna Rasoi as Indira Rasoi Yojana but at-least better late than never. The Annapurna Rasoi Yojana was the demand of the general public and so the current govt. has re-started this scheme with a new name. Former CM also said that the government should change itself rather than names otherwise the public will change everything.Here is the official notification \u2013 Rajasthan Indira Rasoi Yojana Notification  Sarkari Yojana App - Download Now Source / Reference Link: https://twitter.com/ashokgehlot51, https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/jaipur/rajasthan-to-launch-indira-rasoi-yojana-to-provide-meals-at-concessional-rate-6471585/  at  "}
