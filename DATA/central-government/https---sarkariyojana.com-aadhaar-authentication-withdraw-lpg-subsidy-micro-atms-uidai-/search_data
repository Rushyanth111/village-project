AEPS is providing assistance to beneficiaries who lives in remote villages. Till date, around 14 crore beneficiaries under Pahal and Ujjwala scheme are receiving gas cylinder subsidy directly into their bank accounts every month.Central govt. is providing subsidy on a portion of the LPG price which is done by transferring subsidy directly into the bank account of the users. Beneficiaries can even use this subsidy money to buy LPG at market price. UIDAI said that there are around 6 lakh villages and there are only around 1.4 lakh brick and mortar bank branches.Most of the population lives around 30 to 40 km away from a bank branch. Accordingly, to provide assistance to such beneficiaries, this facility to withdraw money online through mobile Aadhaar based micro-ATMs at their doorsteps is of great help.Currently, around 8 crore people makes more than 14 crore AEPS transactions per month. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Act (MGNREGA) workers would also be able to withdraw their wages in their villages through the AEPS micro-ATMs. AEPS system ensures that the government scheme benefits and subsidy money reaches directly to the beneficiaries and eliminates the involvement of any middlemen.Source : https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/aadhaar-authentication-to-withdraw-lpg-subsidy-at-micro-atms-to-continue-uidai/articleshow/66276189.cms  Sarkari Yojana App - Download Now  at  "}
