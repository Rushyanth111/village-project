The central govt. may choose to subsidize a part of the price but still tax needs to be paid at the market rates. So along with the fall in market price or non-subsidised LPG price, the tax incidence on subsidized cooking fuel has also come down which leads to the current price reduction.This subsidy amount varies on a monthly basis as per the changes in the average international benchmark LPG rate and foreign exchange rate. Whenever international oil rates move up, the government provides a higher subsidy and when rates for oil come down, subsidy is cut. The subsidy amount to be transferred into the bank account of the customers is now Rs. 165.47 in Delhi, Rs. 186.43 in Kolkata, Rs. 138.81 in Mumbai and Rs. 191.66 in Chennai per cylinder in February 2019.\u2014 For more details, visit the official website https://www.iocl.com/products/indanegas.aspx  Sarkari Yojana App - Download Now  at  "}
