The central govt. shall also make contribution to pension fund an equal amount as contributed by the eligible farmer.After the subscriber\u2019s death, while receiving pension the spouse of SMF beneficiary would receive 50% of pension received by beneficiary as family pension. For this, he / she must not already be an SMF beneficiary of the PM Kisan Pension Scheme.In case the death of the subscriber happens during the period of contribution, then spouse shall have the option of continuing the scheme by paying regular contribution or terminating it.Synergy b/w PM Farmer Pension Scheme & PM Kisan Samman Nidhi YojanaThere would be complete synergy between PM Farmer Pension Scheme & PM Kisan Nidhi Yojana.
