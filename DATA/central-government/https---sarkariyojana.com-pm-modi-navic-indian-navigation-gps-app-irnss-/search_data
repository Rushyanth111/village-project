This IRNSS System will provide a position accuracy of better than 20 m in primary service area.NavIC system is specifically designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India. This system has coverage range extending upto 1500 km from its boundary (primary service area).Applications of IRNSS \u2013 NAVIC Indian Navigation GPS SystemVarious applications for which NAVIC GPS App (Navigator) could be used are as follows:-Terrestrial, Aerial and Marine NavigationUsage in Disaster Management ActivitiesTracking of vehicles and fleet managementIntegration with mobile phonesPrecise TimingMapping and Geodetic data captureTerrestrial navigation assistance for hikers and travellersVisual and voice navigation for driversPeople can use this App as \u201cNavigator\u201d which is necessary to reach any place across India. This is a Swadeshi GPS system, which is developed entirely by our scientists. Now the country will not have to be dependent on other countries for navigation aid in NAVIC GPS App.NAVIC GPS App Implementation \u2013 IRNSS Satellites Launched by ISROTill date, ISRO has build total 9 satellites in IRNSS series of which 8 satellites are in orbit while 1 is unsuccessful in its launch. 3 satellites are in geostationary orbit (GEO) and 5 satellites are in geosynchronous orbits (GSO) to maintain an inclination of 29\u00b0 to the equatorial plane. The 8 satellites which are currently in orbit are as follows:-Name of SatelliteLaunch DateIRNSS 1A2 July 2013IRNSS 1B4 April 2014IRNSS 1C16 October 2014IRNSS 1D28 March 2015IRNSS 1E20 January 2016IRNSS 1F10 March 2016IRNSS 1G28 April 2016IRNSS 1I12 April 2018PM Modi has named the IRNSS constellation as \u201cNavIC\u201d (Navigation with Indian Constellation) and dedicated IRNSS 1G satellite to the nation. PSLV-39 / IRNSS 1H is unsuccessful during its launch, so it could not reach the orbit. NAVIC GPS App will soon become functional and will replace all the existing GPS Systems.
