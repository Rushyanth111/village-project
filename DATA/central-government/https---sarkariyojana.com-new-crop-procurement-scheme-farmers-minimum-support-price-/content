Under MAS, central govt. will provide 100% compensation to state govt. if the loss in procurement and other operations is upto 25% of MSP value of crop. If loss in procurement is between 25% to 30% of MSP value, then Centre and States share of compensation is in the ratio of 60:40.", "004-listElement": "- Moreover if procurement loss is 30% to 40% MSP Value then burden will get shared in 50:50 ratio.
