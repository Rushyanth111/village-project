It is because only one indicator is identified as part of Citizen Centric Governance sector till date. The central govt. has GGI to assess he state of governance across the country.Good Governance Index (GGI) BackgroundThe Good Governance Index was conceptualized under the first term of the Modi government after the Sectoral Group of Secretaries on Governance recommended developing an index to gauge the performance of states. This GGI index aims to realize the PM Modi\u2019s vision of \u201cmaximum governance, minimum government\u201d. GGI has been developed as a tool to help states make informed policy decisions and bring a targeted approach to achieve maximum good governance.Good Governance Index through 10 sectors and 50 indicators, measures delivery of \u201cgood governance\u201d to citizens by way of delivery of essential services to citizens.
