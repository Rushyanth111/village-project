In this amendment, the central govt. has increased paid maternity leave to women employees from 12 weeks to 26 weeks.The implementation of this scheme is good in public sector but there are some reports which stated that its implementation is not good in private sector and contract jobs.Private sector establishments are not encouraging women employees as if they are employed, then employers would have to provide maternity benefit to them, particularly 26 weeks of paid holiday.Ministry of labour and employment is getting complaints from various quarters that when employers comes to know that their women employee are going to apply for maternity leave, then their contracts are dismissed on some flimsy grounds.So, govt. is working on an Maternity Leave Incentive scheme where 7 weeks of wages would be reimbursed to employers who employ women workers with wage ceiling upto Rs. 15,000 and provide maternity leave (paid) for 26 weeks subject to certain conditions.An estimated amount of Rs. 400 crore is necessary for the financial implication for Govt. of India for implementing the proposed incentive scheme.This clarification was necessary as certain reports are coming before the labour ministry on how the extended maternity leave is becoming deterrent for female employees who are asked to quit or retrenched on flimsy grounds before they go to the maternity leave. Maternity Leave Incentive Scheme will assist employers in paying paid leave to women which will encourage employment for women in public as well as private sectors.
