People can also check the requested period of employment, period & work on which employment offered and period & work on which employment given.What is MGNREGA Act, 2005?Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA or NREGA) is an Indian labour law and social security measure that aims to guarantee the \u201cright to work\u201d and was passed in September 2005. This scheme aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at-least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to each household. For this, adult members must volunteer to do unskilled work.NREGA was scoped up to cover all the districts of India from 1 April 2008 as the largest and most ambitious social security and public works programme in the world. Another aim of MGNREGA is to create durable assets (such as roads, canals, ponds and wells). Employment is to be provided within 5 km of an applicant\u2019s residence, and minimum wages are to be paid.How Does NREGA Scheme Benefit Poor People?In case work is not provided within 15 days of applying, applicants are entitled to an unemployment allowance. This means that if the government fails to provide employment, it has to provide certain unemployment allowances to those people. Thus, employment under NREGA Scheme is a legal entitlement. MGNREGA is to be implemented mainly by gram panchayats (GPs) and the involvement of contractors is banned.Apart from providing economic security and creating rural assets, NREGA can help in protecting the environment, empowering rural women, reducing rural-urban migration and fostering social equity. The law provides many safeguards to promote its effective management and implementation. The act explicitly mentions the principles and agencies for implementation, list of allowed works, financing pattern, monitoring and evaluation, and most importantly the detailed measures to ensure transparency and accountability.Official References Official Website: http://nrega.nic.in  Sarkari Yojana App - Download Now  at  "}
