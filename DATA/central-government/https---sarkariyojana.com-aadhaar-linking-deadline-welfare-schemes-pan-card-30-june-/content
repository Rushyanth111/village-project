Aadhar PAN Linking is mandatory under the Law while this is not the case with other services. In July 2017, Modi govt. under Section 139 AA (2) of the Income Tax Act made it mandatory for every person having PAN (as on 1 July 2017) and eligible to obtain Aadhaar to compulsorily intimate his Aadhaar number to tax authorities.", "005-normal": "5 Judge bench of SC says that central govt. cannot force people to link Aadhaar Card till the final decision comes on petitions challenging the constitutional validity of biometric system and thus enabling law. As per central govt., Aadhar Linking will bring transparency, weed out black money and help in direct benefit transfer to poor."}}
