This month, the price of non-subsidized LPG in Delhi has been reduced by around Rs. 120.50 per cylinder to reflect fall in international oil rates and strengthening of the US Dollar-Rupee exchange rate. Moreover, this reduction is due to tax impact on reduced market rate of the fuel.As per tax rules, GST on LPG is being calculated at the market rate of the fuel. The govt. may choose to subsidize a part of the price but tax needs to be paid at the market rates. So, with the fall in market price or non-subsidised LPG price, the tax incidence on subsidized cooking fuel has also come down which leads to the current price reduction.This subsidy amount varies on a monthly basis as per the changes in the average international benchmark LPG rate and foreign exchange rate. When international rates move up, the government provides a higher subsidy and when rates come down, subsidy is cut. The subsidy amount to be transferred into the bank account of the customers is now Rs. 194.01 in Delhi, Rs. 215.91 in Kolkata, Rs. 167.34 in Mumbai and Rs. 221.62 in Chennai per cylinder in January 2019.References\u2014 Check 14.2 Kg Subsidized LPG gas cylinder previous prices (Month Wise) here. \u2014 Check 14.2 Kg Non-subsidized LPG gas cylinder previous prices (Month Wise) here. \u2014 For more details, visit the official website https://www.iocl.com/products/indanegas.aspx  Sarkari Yojana App - Download Now  at  "}
