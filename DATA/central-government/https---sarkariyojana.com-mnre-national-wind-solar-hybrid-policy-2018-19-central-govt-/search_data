However there is a precondition that the rated power capacity of 1 resource must be at-least 25% of the total rated power capacity of any other resource. After this precondition is satisfied, it must be a recognized hybrid project. The important features and highlights of the National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy 2018-19 are as follows:-All the already existing wind and solar projects will be hybridized with higher transmission capacity than the previously sanctioned project. For this bigger project, there must be an adequate availability of margin in the already existing capacity for transmission.Another striking feature of this new hybrid policy is that the procurement of power will be done from a hybrid project. This would be a tariff based transparent bidding process. For this project, various governmental entities can invite bids or tenders.National Wind \u2013 Solar Hybrid Policy 2018-19 will also allow the usage of battery for storage purposes in the hybrid projects to maximize / optimize the output. Moreover, this new policy will reduce the variability component."}
