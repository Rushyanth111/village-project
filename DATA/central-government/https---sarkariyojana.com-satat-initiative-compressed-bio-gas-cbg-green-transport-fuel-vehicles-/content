These sources includes agriculture residue, cattle dung, sugarcane press mud, municipal solid waste, sewage treatment plant waste etc. After purification process is complete, this bio-gas is compressed and is then called Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG). It has methane content of 95% which is similar to compressed natural gas (CNG), so it can be used in vehicles as an alternative, renewable automotive fuel. CBG can replace CNG in industrial and commercial uses also in the upcoming years. The benefits of usage of compressed bio gas (CBG) are as follows:-", "002-listElement": "- Responsible waste management and reduction in carbon emissions and pollution.", "003-listElement": "- To provide an additional revenue source for farmers.", "004-listElement": "- CBG provides boost to entrepreneurship, rural economy and employment.", "005-listElement": "- Changing to compressed bio-gas would result in supporting national commitments to achieve climate change goals.", "006-listElement": "- This would bring a reduction in import of natural gas and crude oil.", "007-listElement": "- CBG will act as buffer against oil / gas price inflations.", "008-normal": "India has a potential of producing 62 million tonnes of compressed bio-gas per annum. Various plants for producing CBG will be setup primarily through independent entrepreneurs. Working group on biofuels setup under National Policy on Biofuels 2018 is going to finalize the pricing model for compressed bio-gas.", "009-normal": "The complete plan is to start 5,000 CBG plants across India in a phased manner. Out of these, 250 plants would be setup by FY 2020, 1000 plants by FY 2022 and 5000 plants by 2025. The total production capacity for CBG is expected to be around 15 million tonnes per annum. The central govt. is going to make an investment of Rs. 1.7 lakh crore which will provide direct employment for 75000 people and production of 50 million tonnes of bio-manure for crops."}}
