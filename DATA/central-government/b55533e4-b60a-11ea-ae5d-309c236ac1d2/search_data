This is essential in order to provide benefits of social security schemes at single point. Moreover after the registration process is complete, govt. may bring Labour Code on Social Security & welfare. UWIN Cards are efficient and the pilot phase results of this system are satisfactory.However, primary issue remains that who will pay contribution to the informal workers under schemes of EPFO and ESIC. Under these schemes, employees and employers both contribute to social security scheme accounts. Accordingly, govt. plans to formulate a separate mechanism to collect funds as employers will not contribute for this scheme.Central govt. wants to assign social security code to the informal labourers. This new code will resolve the issue of employer contribution. In addition to this, code also facilitate the worker to become a principal employer if worker is an informal or non-employee. This code will eliminate the need of principal employer to subscribe and avail benefits of social security schemes.Furthermore, code on Social Security & Welfare would merge all 15 existing social security laws. This will include EPF & MP Act, ESI Act, Maternity Benefit Act, Payment of Gratuity Act, Employees Compensation Act, Unorganized Social Security Act and several other Welfare Cess or Fund Acts.
