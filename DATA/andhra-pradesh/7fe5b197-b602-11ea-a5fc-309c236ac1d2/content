HC has put a stay order on the launch of this AP Basavatarakam Mother Kits Scheme. This women welfare scheme is facing criticism on its naming after Nandamuri Basavatarakam who was no way associated with the state government.", "002-normal": "The primary cause of the stay order is that the state govt. invites \u201cTenders\u201d by fixing a price tag of each kit at Rs. 1,038. Another company has come forward to provide kits at lower cost than its competitors. However, the company which quoted the higher amount is being given the tender for some undisclosed reasons. AP CM is currently holding the Health Ministry which means that he himself has finalized the prizes. So, the High Court didn\u2019t allow the roll out of Basavatarakam Kits scheme on 15 August 2018."}}
