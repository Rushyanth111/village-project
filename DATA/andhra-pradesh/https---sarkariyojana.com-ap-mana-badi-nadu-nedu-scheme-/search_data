School buildings, computer labs, separate toilets for girls and boys will be constructed in govt. schools in next 4 years. Mandal education officers at mandal level will monitor the developmental activities.Several engineers will take up the construction of additional classrooms and restore old buildings with new ones. Furthermore, the parent\u2019s committees will play significant role in the scheme and development works will be taken considering their suggestions. All those people who wants to do something in their hometown can share their ideas and advises to community contracting method.English Instruction Medium in AP Govt. SchoolsTo improve education standards, AP govt. will introduce English medium of instruction in government schools for class I to VI from the next academic year. Some people are opposing english medium of education in the name of protecting and preserving Telugu culture. But without being taught in English, students will end up in menial and unskilled jobs. They will end up as daily wage earners or car drivers in case they are not in a position to compete in the international job market.For both teachers and students, changing from telugu to english medium of instruction will be a tedious task. For this purpose, teachers would be given training. The state govt. will introduce bridge courses and setup english labs. In the last financial year, AP govt. had only allocated Rs. 20 crore for 45,000 government schools.AP govt. will also provide Rs. 15,000 per annum to every parent who admits his children in school. Moreover, AP govt. will also extend Rs. 20,000 per year to every mother who admits her child in degree or engineering courses to meet mess charges and other expenses.
