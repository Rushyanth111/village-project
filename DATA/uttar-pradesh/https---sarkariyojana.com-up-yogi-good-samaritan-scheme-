All those people who comes forward to help and take injured people to hospitals for treatment will get Rs. 2,000. The proposal for Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme has been sent and the scheme is expected to start in the next 2 or 3 months.", "002-normal": "Previously, the state govt. has formulated policy to protect Good Samaritan which is existing since January 2016, but it is not enough. This move of providing Rs. 2,000 will minimize deaths from road accidents and make medical assistance available to victims within the crucial golden hour (1st hour after accident).", "003-normal": "Bystanders, who assist road accident victims already enjoys legal protection from police and hospital questioning and other legal hassles under the good Samaritan law. This law was made by the central government made after Supreme Court judgment in 2014.", "004-normal": "Delhi, Gujarat, Odisha, Karnataka and Maharashtra already have Good Samaritan Scheme. Every state follows a different procedure to provide cash incentives to volunteers, so UP govt. has to lay down a procedure before official launch of scheme. The state govt. is expected to earmark Rs. 50 lakh for funding the Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme.", "005-normal": "However, the money will come from the Road Safety Fund and not the state govt\u2019s budget. UP has lesser number of road accidents but the highest number of deaths. The major reason is that people doesn\u2019t assist victims and a large number of injured persons lacks timely hospitalization. Yogi Good Samaritan Scheme in UP will encourage and motivate volunteers to help the injured ones.", "006-normal": "Source / Reference Link: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/up-government-to-provide-rs-2000-incentive-to-good-samaritan/articleshow/70204638.cms"}}
