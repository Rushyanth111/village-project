Efforts are on to lift 3 TMC of water from FY 2020.This is the only project in the world which caters to the water needs of 45 lakh acres of agricultural land, hundreds of industries and drinking water to thousands of villages.It is for the 1st time that water is lifted from Godavari river in phases from 92 meters height for supply of water to farmland taking it upto 618 meters height.One of the main reason for construction of Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project is to get state\u2019s legitimate share in river waters. Telangana is geographically located 100 metres above the sea level and could not construct a dam across the Godavari to tap water. In case a huge dam was constructed, almost half of the Telangana and neighbouring Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh would be submerged.
