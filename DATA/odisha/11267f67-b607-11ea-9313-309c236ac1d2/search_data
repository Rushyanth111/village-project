These youths includes all the students who completed their graduation and post graduation degree from universities and are looking for a career in administrative jobs in civil services, banks, insurance sectors or in private sectors. But the success rate of graduates from Odisha universities in national level competitive examinations without any preparatory training was lower.So, the students had to travel to Delhi to prepare for Civil Service examinations. In Delhi, students get access to quality library and private coaching centres having good and dedicated teachers. For poor but talented students of Odisha, getting training in New Delhi by spending huge amount of fees and living expenses is difficult. So, the state govt. tries to tackle this problem by funding high quality training centres in universities.Though these centres will take some time to stabilize, so govt. felt an urgent need of selection of coaching centre which can impart quality training in a focusses manner. Moreover, the coaching center must have credential of imparting effective coaching for UPSC civil service exam and whose success rate must also be high. So, DHE Odisha has selected M/s Dhyeya IAS, New Delhi after following a transparent tender process. The coaching center has been established in Bhubaneswar in order to ensure that Odia students gets coaching opportunity in their home State.Helpline Number / Official Website\u2014 For more information, candidates can call on the helpline number at 0674-2531977 / 7656949029. \u2014 For more details, visit the official website at http://dheodisha.gov.in/Higher-Education/  Sarkari Yojana App - Download Now Source / Reference Link: dheodisha.gov.in  at  "}
