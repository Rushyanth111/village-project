Now the state govt. has issued new directions to sell 50% of houses developed under PMAY at RR rates. Till date, developers sell the flats at 20% to 25% more cost than RR rates. Developers building houses under PMAY Maharashta 2018 Scheme were also offered an additional 2.5 FSI incentive. So, all the developers needs to hand over 50% of total PMAY houses constructed to Maharashtra government. Rest of the houses can be sold at the market rates.30 Developers in the state have agreed to enter into Public Private Partnership (PPP) model to construct low-cost houses. Housing dept. has issued a new notification for this purpose. Private landowners having more than 10 acres of land are eligible to participate in the scheme. PPP model is benefiting industry to a great extent. Most of the people owned large parcels of land but did not have the finance to develop real estate projects. Now with this 2.5 FSI, all the developers can construct new houses and ensure sale of housing projects.PMAY Maharashtra Implementation New PolicyPreviously, Rates of Houses were fixed in accordance with MHADA policy. Now the rates of new PMAY Houses will be fixed either on RR or proposed project cost rates (whichever is lower). The new policy will increase the housing stock in the entire state. Of the total housing units, 35 per cent will be given to landowners and 65 per cent to Mhada. The decision to offer 2.5 FSI to developer is a good move and will benefit poor people.
