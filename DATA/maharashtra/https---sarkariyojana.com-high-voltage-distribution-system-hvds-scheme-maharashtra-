Maharashtra govt. is going to launch One Farmer One Transformer Scheme to provide separate electricity connections for villages and farms. For now, govt. has launched HVDS Scheme whose details are as follows:-", "002-listElement": "- Govt. has approved High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) Scheme to provide electricity connections and to ensure proper power supply to farmers for agriculture.", "003-listElement": "- Now every 2 farmers will share a single transformers through HVDS lines under this scheme.", "004-listElement": "- This scheme will reduce the line losses from 50% to 15% in some places.", "005-listElement": "- Maharashtra govt. will launch this scheme on 15 August 2018 and on the same day, govt. will start providing transformers upto 31 March next year.", "006-listElement": "- In the current scenario, around 10 to 15 farmers receive electricity through 65 to 100 Kilovolt-Ampere (kVA) lines. This leads to low voltage electricity and power tripping due to defects in transformers.", "007-listElement": "- The state govt. has made budgetary allocation of Rs. 600 crore for Marathwada and Vidarbha Regions.

Even the state govt. has stopped disconnecting electricity connections for the bill defaulters.", "011-normal": "As a pro-farmer govt., around 4 lakh farmers have already received agricultural pumps connections in the previous 3 years. Each agricultural connection costs around Rs. 1.5 lakh. So, the state govt. is making all possible efforts to raise the standards of living of poor farmers."}}
